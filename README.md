## Cleaning, analysis and visualisation of biolog plates

This is the repository for the cleaning, analysis and visualisation of biolog plates, based on the data provided by Alex Vujakovic

### To run 

- Download the folder using Git and GitHub or if you are not familiar with GitHub you can download the whole folder using the big green button on the top right of the screen (called "Clone or Download") and select "Download zip".
- In RStudio (I recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), open the Rstudio project file `alex_biolog.Rproj`. This will set all the paths relative to where this folder resides and will allow the analysis to be run across multiple machines.
- Open package_install.R and run that script. This will install all of the packages necessary to run the script.
- Open analysis.R and this will run the script for the cleaning, analysis and visualisation of the biolog plate data
